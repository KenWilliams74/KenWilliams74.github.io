Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

Directions
First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

Create the following pages: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.

Using Bootstrap, create your portfolio site with the following items:

A navbar

A responsive layout

Responsive images

The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

The index.html page should have the following:

An About Me section with an image and a short bio. The text should flow around the image in some form.
The portfolio.html should have the following:

A Gallery of some sort with repeating images overlaid with links. This is to be filled in later with your projects!
The contact.html should have the following:

A Form to send you a message in case someone finds your portfolio!
My Notes************************

This was a challenging yet rewarding project. The biggest obstacle was getting it to be mobile friendly. I had to change my index page a bit to get it to fit properly. The meta tag worked for all the other sizes but not for mobile when I opened it in dev tools. I will have to do more research to see how to float things better and practice other methods of contructing rows and columns. I had a php file from what I looked up to make the contact page work but when I pushed it to github it said there was a server error so I deleted the file.
